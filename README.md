# 🍇 Wine Clustering using DBSCAN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs wine data clustering using the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. It groups similar wine samples based on their chemical properties without using labeled data.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify natural clusters in the wine dataset and detect noise/outliers using an unsupervised machine learning technique.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm

## 📊 Dataset
- Wine Dataset
- Features include:
  - Alcohol
  - Malic Acid
  - Ash
  - Magnesium
  - Flavanoids
  - Proline
  (and other chemical properties)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit (for interactive app)

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing & scaling
- DBSCAN clustering implementation
- Noise point detection
- Cluster visualization using plots
- Interactive prediction using Streamlit app

## 📈 Output
- Groups similar wine samples into clusters
- Identifies outliers (noise points)
- Visual representation of clusters

## 🌐 Deployment
This project is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application where users can explore clustering behavior.
